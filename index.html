            <h2>
                Let's start by answering "What is a radix?"
            </h2>
            <p>
                The official definition of Radix is: <em><strong>The base of a system of numeration</strong></em>.<br>
                In other words, it's the system we use to count, what we use usually in daily life is the <em><strong> decimal radix</strong></em>, which has 10 digits (0, 1, 2 ... 9). <br>
                Decimal radix is been around for a very long time, it's what we teach our children at schools, we use it to do math operations, describe bank accounts data...etc.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Decimal as in "decimus", pardon my Latin!
            </h2>
            <p>
                "Decem" in Latin means 10, and "decimus" means tenth, hence decimal is the base-10 numeration system, but why 10? why not 8? Or 79?<br>
                Let's remember that numeration systems aren't a natural resourse, numbers don't grow on trees, and we didn't excavate them from a radix mine, what I want to say, is that numbers are a human invention, decimal is simply the numeration system that gained concensus, the system that people in general found suitable to use, so why base-10? Well take a look at your hands, count your fingers, here you go, our hands are the most accessible tools that we can use to count, you don't need nail and clay, you don't need pen and paper, all you need is to look at your hands and start spreading your fingers while counting.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>
                Are there other radixes?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Well yes, there are radixes other than the decimal, among them the binary (base 2) radix and the hexadecimal (base 16) radix, actually you can pick a number, use it as a numeration system base, give your invention a name, and here you go, you have a new radix! But let's not rush it, let's go back to the basics, why is decimal the most popular radix? And most importantly, why do we need other radixes?
            </p>
           
            <h2>
                Why do we need other Radixes?
            </h2>
            <div class="with-image">
                <p>
                    With decimal already invented and gained concensus long time ago, we have the most suitable radix to our organic structure, why do we need other radixes? Well, our hands are great organs, but we value our brains higher,<em><strong><q>I think therefor I am</q></strong></em>, according to <em><strong>Ren√© Descartes</strong></em>.<br> We invent things to serve us better than what nature can offer to us, some of these things do not have 10 fingers, or let me say 10 states. Binary (base-2) was invented by <em><strong>Gottfried Leibniz</strong></em> and published in 1703. The beauty in binary radix, is that it has only 2 digits, or 2 states, 1 or 0, true or false, it is very simple, and very definite, like black and white. Deciaml stayed king of radixes, and still is,but during and after the  <em><strong>Digital Revolution</strong></em>, binary radix started to gain grounds, for very simple and technical reasons: Boolean Algebra, relays, and transistors.

            <h2>IT'S ALIVE!</h2>
            <P>
                Well I don't want to go technical here, math teachers used to scare me more than dentists. And we don't really need to bring the blackboard and chalks to understand why binary was essential for inventing digital computers, it's simply because of memory, I won't go into details about how this electronic memory evolved from pineapple-sized vacuum tubes to microscopic transistors, all generations of digital memory so far have one thing in common, they can only count up to one! (quantum memory aside).<br>
                A digital memory unit in a computer can have one of <em><strong>two states</strong></em> only, it's either charged, or not, think about it as a light bulb, a light bulb can either be <em><strong>on or off</strong></em>. there's no half half case, no grey areas, it's either black or white, if you've been paying attention, that's the case with the binary radix. And the most important thing about the electronic (or digital) memory, is that it can keep the charge (when it has one) even when it's not connected to a battery, imagine a light bulb that stays lit, even when you remove the battery. How's that possible? It's like magic! Yes, it is, boolean algebra applied to relays, lots of wires and large light bulb like devices, that were replaced later with transistors, then smaller transistors ... But I'll keep my promise and keep things simple. At this stage, we only need to know, that the invention of electronic memory, or <em><strong>holding a charge independently</strong></em> made computers possible, and when I say computers, I mean all kinds of modern digital computers, including your smartphone, the control system in the nuclear power plant, the auto-pilot landing your next flight, and many more.

            <h2>Power in numbers</h2>
            <p>
                But how can such a tiny short memory save any significant information? Charge and no charge, zero and one? The answer is simple, how can we count trillions and zillions, with only 10 digits? one light bulb, vacuum tube or transistor (or let's call it bit) can only do little, but with billions of bits, we can store all the books that were ever written in one storage device, To explain this better, let's have a look at the following simple app.<br>
                 we have a representation of a light bulb, or an electronic memory, that can be on or off, click around, and change the group size, click the light bulb to turn it on or off, one bulb is 1 bit of memory, it can save only 1 or 0, try 2 bulbs, or 3, keep going until 8 bulbs, or 8 bits, see how this works.
